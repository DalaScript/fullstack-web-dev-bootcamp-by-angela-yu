<h1>The Best Movies According to Dala</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>I Am Legend</h3>
<p>A powerful mix of action and emotion. I love the post-apocalyptic vibe and Will Smith's performance is unforgettable.</p>

<h3>The Maze Runner (all 3 seasons)</h3>
<p>Fast-paced and full of mystery. I enjoyed the intense survival story and how the plot kept getting deeper.</p>

<h3>The Prestige</h3>
<p>Mind-blowing plot twists. I love movies that make you think, and this one had me hooked until the end.</p>
